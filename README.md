# CHLOE: Cooling and Heating Load Open-source Estimator

**CHLOE** is a simplified Python-based tool that estimates heating and cooling loads with minimal user inputs. Designed for the early stages of building planning, it provides quick yet reasonably accurate load calculations for temperate climates, referencing established German standards and applying targeted simplifications.

## Overview

Early-stage building design often requires a reliable, straightforward method for estimating heating and cooling loads. **CHLOE** (Cooling and Heating Load Open-source Estimator) fills this gap by:

- Simplifying complex standard methodologies.  
- Reducing extensive data requirements typically needed at advanced design stages.  
- Delivering transparent and easily modifiable open-source code.  

CHLOE’s results show deviations of approximately **+16%** for heating loads and **–13%** for cooling loads compared to detailed standard methodologies. While it cannot fully handle complex geometries or advanced passive-cooling strategies, CHLOE provides sufficient accuracy for preliminary HVAC system sizing and energy demand analyses.
